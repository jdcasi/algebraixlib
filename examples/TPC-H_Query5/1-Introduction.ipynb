    "The TPC-H benchmark documentation can be found at [http://www.tpc.org/tpch/][]. It is a series of SQL queries that is provided together with standard data and is used to measure the performance of SQL databases. This is what TPC says about the TPC-H benchmark:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The TPC Benchmarkâ„¢H (TPC-H) is a decision support benchmark. It consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed documentation can be found in [tpch2.17.1.pdf][].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are not interested in showing or comparing performance; we chose a query from this benchmark because it is widely known in the data science community and provides a simple example close to real-world usage. Our library is meant to show how data algebra can be used to consistently represent data in any structure, and to process that data with operations that are mathematically defined.\n",

    "## Our Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "We modified the data for the purposes of this tutorial in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tables `customer`, `orders` and `lineitem` are provided as [CSV][] data. (The TPC-H data generator provides the tables in a different, proprietary format.) See [2-Tables - Representation of Tables][] for details.\n",
    "- The data from the table `supplier` is provided as [RDF][] graph in [Turtle][]. See [3-Graphs - Representation of RDF Graphs as Clans][] for details.\n",
    "- The data from the tables `nation` and `region` is provided as [XML][] document. See [4-Hierarchies - Representation of Hierarchical Data][] for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then modified the query to accomodate the changes in data format, to produce the same result. Here is a short summary of the modifications to the original SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We replaced the implicit joins in the `WHERE` clause with explicit joins and subqueries.\n",
    "- Besides SQL subqueries (which return a table), we introduced two 'pseudo-subqueries' in non-SQL formats:\n",
    "    - One is in SPARQL and queries the RDF graph `supplier`. The SPARQL `SELECT` query naturally returns a table that then can be (SQL-)joined with other tables.\n",
    "    - The other is in XQuery and extracts data from the XML file `regions.xml`. The XQuery result is so formed that it results in a table-like XML structure, that we treat as if it were a table. (The XQuery statement is not executed as actual XQuery; it is there to illustrate what we are doing to the XML data, even though it is not in XML anymore at this point.)\n",
    "- We also removed the final sorting of the results; this is not related to anything we want to show here.\n",
