    "## Representation of Hierarchical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent hierarchical data (like [XML][] or [JSON][] documents) as nested relations, where the right parts of the couplets in a relation are themselves relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An XML element is represented as a couplet, where the left part is the tag name and the right part is the tag content. If the content is only character data, it is represented as an atom in the right part. If the content contains child elements (or the tag contains attributes), it is represented as a set of couplets in the right part, where each such couplet represents a child element, an attribute or the character data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation has a few limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We do not distinguish between child elements and attributes of a given element. Both are represented in the same way.\n",
    "- We do not maintain the order of the child elements. The order of elements in the document is lost in the representation.\n",
    "- We do not allow multiple child elements with matching tag names and contents.\n",
    "- When an element contains character data and has a child element or an attribute, the character data is represented as if it were a child element with tag name `$`. When an element contains character data and doesn't have a child element or an attribute, the character data is represented as the right part of the couplet that represents the element. This results in different representations of character data, depending on other data in the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these issues is a problem for our example. All these issues could be resolved, at the cost of a higher complexity of the representation.\n",

    "The tables `region` and `nation` contain data of a type that is often represented as hierarchical data in an XML document. The world is divided into regions (with a key, a name and a descriptive comment), each of which contains nations (again with a key, a name and a descriptive comment). In the relational (tabular) data, the nations are associated with their region through a `regionkey` column in the `nation` table. In the hierarchical data, this is not necessary; children are already associated with their parents through the structure of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created an XML document `regions.xml` that contains the data of these two tables, in a very straightforward way. The root node is `<regions>`, it contains `<region>` elements that contain the region data from the `region` table and the associated nation data from the `nation` table as `<nation>` child elements.\n",
